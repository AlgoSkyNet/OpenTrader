== Comparing Omelette Reviews

After having used [[Backtesting]], the open trader wants to compare
how the Ingredients performed as a function of the Recipe, or the
choices of configuration parameters used by the Recipe.

After having used [[Backtesting]], the open trader will have a series
of [[Omlettes]], that are stored in HDF5 files. Each of the Ingredients
will have configuration parameters. And each of the [[Omlettes]] will have
Reviews, which are different metrics on the performance each of the [[Omlettes]].
The open trader wants to visualize this data to see how the configuration
parameters effected the metrics of performance.

This is an important use-case as the whole point of [[Backtesting]] is
to find the Recipe and configuration parameters that give the best metrics
of performance. And as there are a lot of different metrics, sometimes
competing or conflicting, it must be easy to browse of visualize this data.

**Tabular:** Perhaps the simplest, and probably the fastest, it to display
the data as in a spreadsheet-like display.

**Plotting.** We can display the data as in graph, but this is slower
and it may not be so easy to visualize large numbers (20-30) of metrics
from each of the Reviews, with  large numbers (10-20) of [[Omlettes]].

We will start with the tabular route, and elaborate it in this use-case.

For this we may have the required tool already: [[TabView]].
