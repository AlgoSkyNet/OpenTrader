== Features Tests

[[UseCases]] are the starting point for our Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
The use cases are elaborated into required feature need to fulfil
the use case, which are turned into BDD test features and scenarios using
[[py-bdd|https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/]].

The currently documented features can be found in the 
[[tests/features/|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/]]
directory of the distribution.



=== OTCmd2_ini

**[[OTCmd2_ini.txt|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/OTCmd2_ini.feature]]**

**Feature:** OTCmd2
  
    Settings for OTCmd2 are in a configobj .ini file that by default is
    found in the same place that the OTCmd2.py file is found, but you can
    use the OTCmd2.py {{{-c}}} or {{{--config}}} command-line option to specify
    an alternate location. It uses configobj with unrepr=True
    so the values are Python, not just strings.
    
**Scenario:** Settings for OTCmd2 are in a configobj .ini file
{{{

      Given The configobj OTCmd2.ini exists
      And The configobj OTCmd2.ini is parseable
      And The configobj has keys:
                          OTCmd2
                          RabbitMQ
                          backtest
                          feed.plot.params
                          matplotlib.rcParams
      And The configobj Section "OTCmd2" has keys:
                          iRetvalTimeout
      Then Life is Good!
