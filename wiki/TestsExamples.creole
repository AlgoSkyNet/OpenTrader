== Examples

Because [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] is a cmd2 application, not only can
it interpret commands in an interactive loop, but it can read
a list of commands from the stdin. This can be used to give
examples of typical use-cases.

Additionally, as we have Python under the cmd2 loop, we can
use Python to make tests or assertions after nay step in the script.
This makes it easy to write scripts as complete use-case tests.

There are a series of example files in the
[[share/examples|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/blob/master/share/examples/]]
directory of the distribution. These example files are [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]]
ommand scripts that you run, for example under Msys or Unix, like this:
{{{
OTCmd2 -P "/c/Program Files/MetaTrader"  < share/examples/OTCmd2-sub.txt
}}

You should see no {{{AssertionError}}}s,  and you should see no timeouts:
{{{
WARN: No retval returned in 60 seconds
}}}
(You can adjust the timeout in the {{{[OTCmd2]}}} section of the
[[OTCmd2.ini|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/blob/master/OpenTrader/OTCmd2.ini]]
config file with the value {{{iRetvalTimeout}}}.)
