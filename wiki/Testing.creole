== Testing ==

[[UseCases]] proceed to getting fleshed out as Features. 
Features are implemented as Gherkin feature files, and tested using
[[behave|https://github.com/behave/behave]]. If you have installed
{{{behave>=1.2.5}}} before installing OpenTrader, then you should be
able to run the test suite from the top-level directory with:
{{{
python setup.py behave_test
}}}
YMMV :-)


=== Features ===

The features can be found in the 
[[tests/features/|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/]]
directory of the distribution.

For the details of our BDD testing, and the currently documented features, see
[[TestsFeatures]].

=== Examples ===

Features that are implemented as commands in [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] also
have tests as examples.Because [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] is a
[[cmd2|https://bitbucket.org/catherinedevlin/cmd2]] application, not only can
it interpret commands in an interactive loop, but it can read a list of
commands from the stdin. This can be used to give examples of typical [[UseCases]].

This makes it easy to write scripts as complete [[UseCase]] tests, giving good coverage.
At the same time, it gives end-users a catalogue of complete working examples.

For the currently scripted examples, see [[TestsExamples]].
