In the main directory of the distribution, run
{{{
python -v tests/
}}}

The features can be found in the 
[[tests/features/|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/]]
directory of the distribution.

=== Examples

Because [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] is a [[cmd2|https://bitbucket.org/catherinedevlin/cmd2]]
application, not only can it interpret commands in an interactive loop,
but it can read a list of commands from the stdin. This can be used to give
examples of typical [[UseCases]].
This makes it easy to write scripts as complete [[UseCase]] tests, giving good coverage.
At the same time, it gives end-users a catalogue of complete working examples.

For the currently scripted examples, see [[TestsExamples]].
