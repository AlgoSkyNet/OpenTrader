== OTMql4AMQP - AMQP bindings for MQL4 Python ==

https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/

OTMql4AMQP project allows the [[OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge|OTMql4Py]]
to work with [[RabbitMQ|http://rabbitmq.org]], or probably any version of AMQP,
the emerging standard for high performance enterprise messaging,
for asynchronous communications between financial and trading applications.
It builds on OTMql4Py, and requires it as a pre-requisite.

In your Python, you must have installed Pika:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/

Pika offers the advantage of being pure Python: no DLLs to compile
or install. Pika communicates with AMQP servers, the most common
open-source one being RabbitMQ: http://www.rabbitmq.com
You will need an AMPQ server installed, configured and running to use this project.
The code assumes the default server setup of
    username: {{{guest}}}, password: {{{guest}}}, virtual host: {{{/}}}
but you can change those when you attach the EA to the chart:
[[OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4]]

Look at the {{{OnTick}} and {{{OnTimer}}} functions of {{{OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4}}}
to see how the EA works to send and receive messages from [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]].

For installation instructions, see [[Installation]].
