Use the Wiki to start topics for discussion; it's better to use the
wiki for knowledge capture, and then we can pull pages back into the
release documentation in the {{{wiki}}} directory. You may need to be
signed into github.com to edit in the wiki.

Please format wiki pages as Creole. http://wikicreole.org/

Please file any bugs in the
[[issues tracker|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/issues]].
