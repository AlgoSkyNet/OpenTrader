==== OTCmd2 backtest omlette

An omlette is an HDF5 file that saves all the information from a backtest,
including the metadata: all of parameter values that were used in the recipe,
the parameters used by the cook, and the servings results.

You should open an omlette before you backtest giving it a filename,
and close it after the 'chef cook' and 'servings'.
{{{
back omlette open FILE           - open an HDF file to save all the backtest parts
back omlette check               - show the current omlette filename
back omlette display             - display the current omlette HDF sections
back omlette close               - close the HDF file saving the omlette
}}}
Real Soon Now you will be able to enjoy them more by reloading previously saved
omlettes, plotting the data or the results, and adding or editing comments.
