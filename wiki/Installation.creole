=== Installation

One day we will make installers for a shrink-wrapped distribution, but
for now, you must clone from https://github.com and manually install.

==== Prerequisites

You must have {{{cmd2}}} installed the Python that runs these scripts:
see https://bitbucket.org/catherinedevlin/cmd2

You must have {{{configobj}}} installed in the Python that runs these scripts.
The up-to-date one is at https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj/

In your Metatrader Python, you also must have installed {{{Pika}}}:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/

===== Plotting Prerequisites

You must have {{{pandas}}} installed in the Python that runs these scripts:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas

You must have {{{matplotlib}}} installed in the Python that runs these scripts:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib

===== Backtesting Prerequisites

For backtesting ([[DocOTCmd2_backtest]]), you need to have {{{pybacktest}}}
installed in the Python that runs these scripts:
https://github.com/ematvey/pybacktest/

You must have {{{pandas}}} installed in the Python that runs these scripts:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas

You will probably also want the Cythoned {{{ta-lib}}} that works with pandas/numpy:
see [[TaLib]].

==== Metatrader Prerequisites

In order to interact with Metatrader, you will need to
install the OTMql4AMQP, OTMql4Py and OTMql4Lib projects from
https://github.com/OpenTrading/ into the Python called by your Metatrader:
* OTMql4AMQP https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/,
* OTMql4Py https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/, and
* OTMql4Lib https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/

One day we will make installers for shrink-wrapped distributions, but
for now, you must clone them from https://github.com and manually install.
Make a directory anywhere called {{{OpenTrading}}, and clone each of the above
into that directory. Then recursively copy the contents of each of the three
{{{MQL4}}} subdirectories into your Metatrader {{{MQL4}}} subdirectory.

You must have a AMQP server running, such as [[RabbitMQ]], by default with the
default guest account: see http://rabbitmq.org 


Attach the
[[OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4]]
EA in [[OTMql4AMQP|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/MQL4/]]
to a chart and make sure it's working; look at the Experts log in Mt4
to see messages of success. With the EA loaded onto a chart, run the
{{{OTCmd2}}} script ([[DocOTCmd2]]) from a command line, with the {{{-P}}
option to give the path to your Metatrader installation. Then give the
command {{{sub run retval.# timer.#}}}. Within about 15 seconds you should
see timer messages coming for your {{{OTMql4AMQP}}} enabled Metatrader.


==== Setup

Clone this project from github
{{{
git clone https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader
}}}
and then run change to the {{{OpenTrader}}} directory and run
{{{
python setup.py
}}}
to create the 3 scripts:

* {{{OTCmd2}}} - see [[DocOTCmd2]]
* {{{OTBackTest}}} - see [[DocOTBackTest]]
* {{{OTPpnAmgc}}} - see [[DocOTPpnAmgc]]
