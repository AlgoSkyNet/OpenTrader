== Omlettes ==

An omlette is an HDF5 file that saves all the information obtained from [[Backtesting]],
including the metadata: all of parameter values that were used in the [[Recipe]],
the parameters used by the Chef, and the Servings results.

Omlettes can be viewed by  [[ViTables|https://github.com/uvemas/ViTables]].

See [[DocOTCmd2_backtest]].
