This is the tabview from the 2015-06-14 mva branch of
https://github.com/wavexx/tabview that handles dictionaries
and pandas series dataframes and panels. For the discussion, see
https://github.com/firecat53/tabview/pull/116

There is a choice of either:
{{{
git clone https://github.com/mdbartos/tabview ; cd tabview ; git checkout feat
}}}
or:
{{{
git clone https://github.com/wavexx/tabview ; cd tabview ; git checkout mva
}}}

We will manually keep the one file {{{tabview.py}}} up to date, or you can
replace it yourself with a more recent version for http://github.com.
