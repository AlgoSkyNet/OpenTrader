== Use Cases ==

Use-cases are the starting point for our Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
The use-cases are elaborated into required feature need to fulfil
the use-case, which are turned into BDD test features and scenarios using
[[behave|http://pypi.python.org/pypi/behave]]. {{{behave}}} is well documented at:
http://pythonhosted.org/behave/ and has a good page describing the philosophy of 
[[behavior-driven development|http://pythonhosted.org/behave/philosophy.html]],
something we have strongly benefited from. Broader 
Ideas are usually collected on the [[RoadMap]] before being elaborated into use-cases.

We also have tried [[py-bdd|https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/]] which
is inspired by {{{behave}}} and uses similar conventions in writing feature files,
but we are having some issues with {{{pytest-bdd}}}: see [[Testing]].

Use-cases proceed to getting fleshed out as features. Features that are implemented
as commands in [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] also have tests as examples: see [[TestsExamples]].

Our feature files can be found in the 
[[tests/features/|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/]]
directory of the distribution. For the currently documented features,
see [[TestsFeatures]].
