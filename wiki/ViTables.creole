== ViTables

[[ViTables|https://github.com/uvemas/ViTables]] can visualize tabular data, based on
[[pytables|http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pytables]].
It is capable of reading HDF5 files, the kind that Pandas
can read and write to, and the kind that are used to write our [[Omlettes]].

There is a plotting plugin to ViTables:
[[VTPlot||github.com/alexey-naydenov/VTPlot]].
