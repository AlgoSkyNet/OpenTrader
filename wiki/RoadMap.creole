== Road Map ==

There are a lot of directions we can take this project, and a lot
of things we can do. The Road Map is ideas that when they are accepted,
proceed to getting fleshed out as [[UseCases]].

The order should be approximately that of importance.

* Elaborate the [[UseCases]] to see what is important.

* Elaborate the [[TestsFeatures]] to ensure coverage.

* Document [[Omlettes]] and make them reloadable.

* Speed up the round-trip time with OTMql4AMQP - try
  [[Rabbit4Mt4|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/wiki/Rabbit4Mt4]].
  If the compiled DLL version of it works, we would greatly simplify distribution.

* Speed up the Python initial load time of [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]].

* Extend the network communication to use ZeroMQ via
  [[OTMql4Zmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq]].
  If the compiled DLL version of it gets fixed, we would greatly simplify distribution.

* Extend the Feed parsing to be able to read Mt HST files.

* Extend the Feed parsing to be able update a CSV file with recent bars
  of the same chart that are currently in a live Mt4.

* Add the ability of compare the reviews of different omletttes: see
  [[ComparingOmeletteReviews]].

* Break out the metrics from the Chefs and have interchangable Reviewers.

* Add event driven Chefs to expand the range of [[Backtesting]].

* Hook up [[Recipes]] to live-trading on Metatrader from recipes and chefs.

* Add Recipes to abstract what [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] needs from a recipe specification.

* Add Chefs to be able to compare chefs on the same recipes.

* Look at integrating {{{pandas_datareaders_unofficial}}} with caching.

* Explore ViTables as a tool to compare the reviews of different omletttes:

  # It should be extended to provide GUI editing of the dictionary stored
  in the metadata slot of pandas objects.
  
  # The log window in ViTables could be replaced by a [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]]
  read-evel-print window,   which would embed OpenTrader in ViTables.
  Then the plotting from [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] under ViTables could get wired up to
  display {{{pandas.plot()}}} in [[VTPlot|http://github.com/VTPlot/alexey-naydenov]]
  using PyQtGraph.
    
* Reduce the amount of syntax needed for [[Recipes]] by adding syntactic sugar.

* Rationalize our syntactic sugar with other <<haute cuisine>> establishments.


* [[UseCases]]
