@pytest
Feature: OTCmd2

  Settings for OTCmd2 are in a configobj .ini file that by default is
  found in the same place that the OTCmd2.py file is found, but you can
  use the OTCmd2.py {{{-c}}} or {{{--config}}} command-line option to specify
  an alternate location. It uses configobj with {{{unrepr=True}}}
  so the values are Python, not just strings.

  Scenario: Settings for OTCmd2 are in a configobj .ini file

    Given The configobj OTCmd2.ini exists
    And   The configobj OTCmd2.ini is parseable
#    And The configobj has keys:
#                        default
#                        RabbitMQ
#                        backtest
#                        feed.plot.params
#                        matplotlib.rcParams
#    And The configobj Section "default" has keys:
#                        iRetvalTimeout
#
