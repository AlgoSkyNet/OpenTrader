== Features Tests

[[UseCases]] are the starting point for our Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
The use cases are elaborated into required feature need to fulfil
the use case, which are turned into BDD test features and scenarios using
[[py-bdd|https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/]].

The currently documented features can be found in the 
[[tests/features/|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/]]
directory of the distribution.
