<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>Use-cases are the starting point for our Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).<br />
The use-cases are elaborated into required feature need to fulfil<br />
the use-case, which are turned into BDD test features and scenarios using<br />
<a href="behave">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/behave</a>. <tt>behave</tt> is well documented at:<br />
<a href="http://pythonhosted.org/behave/">http://pythonhosted.org/behave/</a> and has a good page describing the philosophy of <br />
<a href="behavior-driven development">http://pythonhosted.org/behave/philosophy.html</a>,<br />
something we have strongly benefited from. Broader <br />
Ideas are usually collected on the <a href="RoadMap">RoadMap</a> before being elaborated into use-cases.</p>

<p>We also have tried <a href="py-bdd">https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/</a> which<br />
is inspired by <tt>behave</tt> and uses similar conventions in writing feature files,<br />
but we are having some issues with <tt>pytest-bdd</tt>: see <a href="Testing">Testing</a>.</p>

<p>Use-cases proceed to getting fleshed out as features. Features that are implemented<br />
as commands in <a href="OTCmd2">DocOTCmd2</a> also have tests as examples: see <a href="TestsExamples">TestsExamples</a>.</p>

<p>Our feature files can be found in the <br />
<a href="tests/features/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/</a><br />
directory of the distribution. For the currently documented features,<br />
see <a href="TestsFeatures">TestsFeatures</a>.</p>
