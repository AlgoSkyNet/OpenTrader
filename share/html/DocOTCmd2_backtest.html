	<li>feed      - Create feeds (pandas DataFrames) from CSV OHLCV files</li>
	<li>recipe    - Set the recipe that the chef will use, and make the ingredients from the feeds</li>
	<li>chef      - Set the chef that we will use, and cook from the ingredients and the feeds</li>
	<li>servings  - List the servings the chef has cooked, and dish out the servings</li>
	<li>plot      - Plot the servings the chef has cooked, using matplotlib</li>
</ul>
<h4>OTCmd2 backtest omlette</h4>

<p>An omlette is an HDF5 file that saves all the information from a backtest,<br />
including the metadata: all of parameter values that were used in the recipe,<br />
the parameters used by the cook, and the servings results.</p>

<p>You should open an omlette before you backtest giving it a filename,<br />
and close it after the 'chef cook' and 'servings'.</p>
<pre>
back omlette open FILE           - open an HDF file to save all the backtest parts
back omlette check               - show the current omlette filename
back omlette display             - display the current omlette HDF sections
back omlette close               - close the HDF file saving the omlette
</pre>
<p>Real Soon Now you will be able to enjoy them more by reloading previously saved<br />
omlettes, plotting the data or the results, and adding or editing comments.</p>
