<h2>Testing</h2>

<p><a href="UseCases">UseCases</a> proceed to getting fleshed out as Features. <br />
Features are implemented as Gherkin feature files, and tested using<br />
<a href="behave">https://github.com/behave/behave</a>. If you have installed<br />
<tt>behave&gt;=1.2.5</tt> before installing OpenTrader, then you should be<br />
able to run the test suite from the top-level directory with:</p>
<pre>
python setup.py behave_test
</pre>
<p>YMMV :-)</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>The features can be found in the <br />
<a href="tests/features/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/</a><br />
directory of the distribution.</p>

<p>For the details of our BDD testing, and the currently documented features, see<br />
<a href="TestsFeatures">TestsFeatures</a>.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Features that are implemented as commands in <a href="OTCmd2">DocOTCmd2</a> also<br />
have tests as examples.Because <a href="OTCmd2">DocOTCmd2</a> is a<br />
<a href="cmd2">https://bitbucket.org/catherinedevlin/cmd2</a> application, not only can<br />
it interpret commands in an interactive loop, but it can read a list of<br />
commands from the stdin. This can be used to give examples of typical <a href="UseCases">UseCases</a>.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to write scripts as complete <a href="UseCase">UseCase</a> tests, giving good coverage.<br />
At the same time, it gives end-users a catalogue of complete working examples.</p>

<p>For the currently scripted examples, see <a href="TestsExamples">TestsExamples</a>.</p>
