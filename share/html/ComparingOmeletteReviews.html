<h2>Comparing Omelette Reviews</h2>

<p>After having used <a href="Backtesting">Backtesting</a>, the open trader wants to compare<br />
how the Ingredients performed as a function of the Recipe, or the<br />
choices of configuration parameters used by the Recipe.</p>

<p>After having used <a href="Backtesting">Backtesting</a>, the open trader will have a series<br />
of <a href="Omlettes">Omlettes</a>, that are stored in HDF5 files. Each of the Ingredients in the<br />
Omlette will have configuration parameters. And each of the <a href="Omlettes">Omlettes</a> will have<br />
Reviews, which are different metrics on the performance each of the <a href="Omlettes">Omlettes</a>.<br />
The open trader wants to visualize this data to see how the configuration<br />
parameters effected the metrics of performance.</p>

<p>This is an important use-case as the whole point of <a href="Backtesting">Backtesting</a> is<br />
to find the Recipe and Ingredients configuration parameters that give the best<br />
metrics of performance. And as there are a lot of different metrics, sometimes<br />
competing or conflicting, it must be easy to browse of visualize this data.</p>

<p><strong>Tabular:</strong> Perhaps the simplest, and probably the fastest, it to display<br />
the data as in a spreadsheet-like display.</p>

<p><strong>Plotting.</strong> We can display the data as in graph, but this is slower<br />
and it may not be so easy to visualize large numbers (20-30) of metrics<br />
from each of the Reviews, with  large numbers (10-20) of <a href="Omlettes">Omlettes</a>.</p>

<p>We will start with the tabular route, and elaborate it in this use-case.</p>

<p>For this we may have the required tool already: <a href="TabView">TabView</a>.</p>
