# These tests will only work if you have an OTMql4AMQP enabled Metatrader running,
# the Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4 attached to a chart in it, and
# the RabbitMQ server configured and running.
# echo the commands from the script so that we can watch the progress

# set the on-line target

# We need a listener thread running, subscribed to retval
sub run retval timer
# load the python time module
