### OTCmd2 backtest
```

An omlette is an HDF5 file that saves all the information from a backtest,
including the metadata: all of parameter values that were used in the recipe,
the parameters used by the cook, and the servings results.

You should open an omlette before you backtest giving it a filename,
and close it after the 'chef cook' and 'servings'.

back omlette open FILE           - open an HDF file to save all the backtest parts
back omlette check               - show the current omlette filename
back omlette display             - display the current omlette HDF sections
back omlette close               - close the HDF file saving the omlette

Real Soon Now you will be able to enjoy them more by reloading previously saved
omlettes, plotting the data or the results, and adding or editing comments.
