## Pandas love Omlettes!

### (And you thought pandas were vegans :-)

There are many steps to making a good Omlette:

1. Get a feed to make ingredients out of.

2. Get a Recipe to make the Omlette.

3. Make the Ingredients from the Recipe and the Feed(s).

4. Find a Chef to give the Recipe and Ingredients to.

5. Have the Chef cook the Recipe and Ingredients in the Oven(Backtester).

6. Enjoy the Servings that come out of the the Oven(Backtester).

### HDF5

An omlette is an HDF5 file that saves all the information from a backtest,
including the metadata: all of parameter values that were used in the recipe,
the parameters used by the cook, and the servings results.
