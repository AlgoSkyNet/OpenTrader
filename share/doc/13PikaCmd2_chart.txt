### PikaCmd2 chart
```

Set and query the chart used for messages to and from RabbitMQ:
  list   - all the charts the listener has heard of,
           iff you have already started a listener with "sub run"
  get    - get the default chart to be published or subscribed to.
  set ID - set the default chart ID to be published or subscribed to.
  set    - set the default chart to be the last chart the listener has heard of,
           iff you have already started a listener with "sub run"

The chart ID will look something like: oChart_EURGBP_240_93ACD6A2_1

Usage: chart [options] command

Options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

```
