### OTCmd2_ini

    Settings for OTCmd2 are in a configobj .ini file that by default is
    found in the same place that the OTCmd2.py file is found, but you can
    use the OTCmd2.py '-c' or '--config' command-line option to specify
    an alternate location. It uses configobj with unrepr=True
    so the values are Python, not just strings.
